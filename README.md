Downtime Project

Concept - What to wear / Personal Stylist
The app will serve as a tool to pair up outfits to compare for purchase or to share with friends for feedback. We can use Levi’s for this example since they have a wide range of pieces and we can grab all the images from their site

WALKTHROUGH
Login with your Facebook, Pinterest, Etc
Starting Point - Standard view layout:  Begins with a entire outfit (Shoes, Accessories, etc), with the option to X out items (Eliminate hat or shoes etc).
Filters for starting point can include
Weather
Location (city)
Event (Holiday, wedding, festival) 
Style type (hipster, rocker, classic)
Clothing type (long sleeve, shorts, etc)
Swipe/Click through shirts/jeans to compare combos



“Add to cart” or “Closet” button for each item
The Closet will serve as a storage area for outfits that you’ve matched up and would like to save
Once you add an outfit to your Closet you can share it on your social network (Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram) or via email/text with a friend.
Your closet will be viewable by others for browsing, rating and purchasing items 
(Registry style? calendar updates for birthdays etc)
Example - John’s Birthday is coming up, Laura bought him this shirt he wanted, buy him the matching jeans.



You will also have the option to switch the layout view to a Blog Style (Mix & Match) view, where you can drag items to arrange/layer how you like



WHAT’S NEXT
Rankings determine what’s next in the slide array, based on -
    
Preset stylist type recommendations (based on items from the same line/campaign)
Matchability meter (tag images and create a scale that suggests the highest rated match and orders the array in descending order)
Complementary colors (HSL values?)
Previous Purchases from site?




?????
    
Different shades of models
Follow other people on the app
Browsing History - If you looked at a similar item (Black jeans) on another site, it would recommend a comparable pair of Levis with a message perhaps (Our jeans are better quality than the Burberry pair you looked at)
